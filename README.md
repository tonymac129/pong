# Pong Game
A slightly overengineered version of my CS class's final Java graphics project.

## How to Play?
- Make sure you have JVM or JDK installed on your computer that can run .java files.
### If you have a code editor:
- Open the code editor and install the necessary extensions for Java development.
- Click on run in the code editor and you should be able to play the game, enjoy!
### If you're a normal person (who's not nerdy enough to have a code editor):
- Open the terminal/command line, navigate to the folder, and run "javac *.java"
- This should create a bunch of compiled .class files in the folder
- Run the command "java Pong" and enjoy!
- If you somehow still can't open the game, just ask ChatGPT idk
